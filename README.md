### JAVA JUICE

Java Juice is an application designed to allow users to search coffee shops by the number of outlets available. The goal of the app is to help users avoid running out of battery life while working or studying on the go.

### Login and Registration

When launching the app, the user will be directed to the landing page. To log in, click the login button and enter username and password. If the user does not have an account, click the "Don't have account?" link, enter a new username and password, and click submit.

### Home Page

Upon logging in, the user will be redirected to the home page. The home page displays the user's name and provides brief instructions for the purpose of the app. To begin, the user should click the Search button.

### Search Page

From the search page, a user can search for coffee shop locations within a specific neighborhood and can select the minimum number of outlets required. The search results will display all locations that match the specified criteria. On the search result card, the user can select the MAP button to display a map of the shop's location. To add a location to the user's "My Locations" section, click the ADD button on the result card. The text on the button for that location will change to "Added" to confirm that the location has been added.

### Add Page

The Add page allows users to add new locations to the database. The user should input the name of the location and street address and should select the neighborhood and number of outlets from the dropdown menus. Once submitted, the new location information will be added to the database and the user will be redirected to the search page. The add function allows for the app to grow via a crowd-sourcing model, with multiple users adding new locations to continually grow the database.

### My Locations Page

The My Locations page displays all locations that have been added by the user, regardless of neighborhood or number of outlets. To remove an individual location My Locations, click the DELETE button on the shop's location card. If the location has been personally added by the user, the user will also have the ability to edit the location information. To do so, click the EDIT button on the location card, update the information fields as needed, and click submit. Users can also view maps of individiual locations from the My Locations page by clicking the MAP button on the location card.

### Comments

Users also have the ability to submit comments for individual coffee shop locations. To do so, navigate to the My Locations section and click the COMMENTS button for the specified location. A modal will appear that displays any comments that have already been submitted for that location. In addition to the comment message, each comment will also display the name of the user who submitted the comment and a timestamp of when the comment was submitted. If the user submitted the comment, the comment will also include an option to edit and delete the comment. To edit, click the EDIT button, update the message, and click submit. Upon submission, the timestamp for the comment will also be updated. To remove the comment, click the DELETE button.

### Log Out

To exit the application, click the Log Out button at the top right corner of the screen. Upon logging out, the user will be redirected to the landing page. Logging out will also clear all user information that has been stored by the application during the browsing session.
